# Conditions List

How to run:

Run in following order:

Server: 
- `cd server`
- `npm install`
- `npm start`

Client: 
- `cd client`
- `npm install`
- `npm start`

If not opened automatically , open url `http://localhost:3000`

TODOs:

- The 'find out more' feature is not completed but can be implement using simple local state with character limit. So for e.g. if string is longer then x characters then show 'find out more' link and when press set state to display the whole url.
- Some of the objects could be structured better. for e.g. the conditions in redux.
